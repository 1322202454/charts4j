#summary Charts4j on HTTPS secured sites

= Introduction =

On an HTTPS secured site all resources should be accessed over HTTPS as well. 
So when requesting a google charts image via HTTP the browser would show a warning message about mixed HTTPS and HTTP content.

= Details =

There is a simple solution to this:
{{{
AbstractGChart chart;
...
chart.setURLEndpoint("//chart.googleapis.com/chart");
}}}

 * chart.apis.google.com, the default endpoint, does not currently support HTTPS, but chart.googleapis.com does.
 * The [http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/ protocol-relative] address will let the browser automatically choose whether to use HTTP or HTTPS.
