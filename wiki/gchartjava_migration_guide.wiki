#summary Migration from gchartjava.

This document only applies to developers who wish to migrate from gchartjava, the old name for this project.


The ghcartjava API has changed significantly. The good news is that it is greatly improved, more intuitive and bug free, but the bad news is that backwards compatibility is broken which means developers will have to refactor parts of their code to use the latest version. Here are several hints for upgrading to version 0.6:
  # There is now a strong reliance on static factory methods throughout this API. Refer to item 1 from "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch, 2nd edition for a great discussion on static factory methods. See the Plots and GCharts classes for examples of this concept.
  # Follow [DraftV06 examples].
  # Read the [http://gchartjava.googlecode.com/svn/tags/v0.6RC5/doc/index.html javadoc].
