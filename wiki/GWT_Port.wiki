#summary GWT Port Information.

= Introduction =

The goal of the charts4j-gwt port is to offer GWT client-side support of the charts4j project. Most notably, charts4j-gwt conforms to the GWT JRE subset. The API is identical to that of charts4j, but we made a few changes "under the hood" to achieve GWT JRE compliance. The port also contains GWT specific files such as the module XML definition.

With charts4j-gwt, data can be passed to browser and rendered in any of the supported Google Chart API charts leveraging the GWT.

Note that in a GWT environment, charts4j has always functioned server-side, in the servlet layer, as is, but this port adds GWT client side support for charts4j.

This port is compatible with GWT 1.5 and above.
